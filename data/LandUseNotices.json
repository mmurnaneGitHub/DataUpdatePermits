The current setback is 19' instead of the required 25'.  I recently purchased the house and the porch was already part of the structure which was clearly built many years ago.

There is no other feasible space inside the house to move these necessities to.\r\n\r\nI do plan on leaving the 6' tall fence in the backyard, not placing any windows into the porch/mud room, and retaining the existing grass for the full 19' to provide privacy for the rear neighbor.\r\n\r\nI originally met with land use on Aug 14th and received an approval for the structure, BLDRA17-0617.

In September-June we operated Monday through Friday from 8:30-11:30. Each day we have 8 students. Parents dropped their children off at the entrance on Madison Street. They parked on the street for an average of 1-10 minutes at 8:30 and 11:30.  Many families, including ours, walk or bike to school since they live in the neighborhood. Some families carpool.  On average there are 4-7 cars during those 1-10 minute drop-off times.  \r\n\r\nSince opening in September we have consistently had 7 families every day. We have no problems filling enrollment because there is such a need and demand for our type of program. We have built such a respectable reputation in the community. We have only had two sets of flyers and didn't need to advertise more than this.  All year long we have been building our waiting list. At the time of our Open House the second Saturday of March, we had 42 families on the waitlist.  \r\n\r\nFrom the returning families we have filled up our morning program. Only four children will be leaving the program. Two are leaving due to graduating to kindergarten and two students are moving out of the state. The remaining students want to return and all have increased their days.\r\n\r\nAt the Open House we were able to enroll new families and are completely full. We will operate an additional Monday through Friday for three hours from 1:00-4:00. Parent will drop their children off at the Madison entrance.  \r\n\r\nWe are friends with many of the neighbors due to connections we already had. I was a teacher for one of the families, and teach at Geiger Montessori where another neighbor child attends. I also am friends with a couple across the street from the gym.  They appreciate the work we do, support us, and are on very friendly terms with us.\r\n\r\nThere is such a need for an all-outdoor program in Tacoma.  The latest research shows children need to be outside. Parents are learning this and are asking for similar programs all over the nation. I was trained at CedarSong Nature School on Vashon. The instructor has trained over 100 teachers in this growing movement.  Snake Lake has a wonderful outdoor component to their nature school and they have always had a limited amount of openings with parents waiting to secure the few openings they have each year. We are in partnership with them, and in March they sent two teachers to observe our school because they have seen the demand we have and are opening an all-outdoor session.  There is a great need and our preschool is already a model to those who are starting new ones.\r\n\r\n Our program is also bilingual.  Even though Tacoma has such a diverse population, there is limited programs in different languages.  We were looking to teach my son Chinese starting as baby as well since I am of Chinese heritage. The programs all start at 4 years old.  Families need programs that start at 2 years of age. All the programs in Tacoma start at 3 or older. There is research that shows early language immersion is very important. We have many families who are interested because they speak Spanish at home and want the language reinforced at school.  Currently there are only two other options for this. Only one starts as young as 2 the other starts in Kindergarten.  \r\n\r\nWe are a unique combination of both an all-outdoor and bilingual program. This has never been done in Tacoma but also surrounding areas and we have had many other Nature School teachers contact us for more information about this.  There is nothing like Chavitos in Tacoma and this is proven by the demand we have from parents and how well we are known in the community.", "Address": "806 S PROCTOR ST", "Notice_Date": "", "Current_Status": "Cancelled", "Latitude": "47.253157", "Link": "https://aca.accela.com/tacoma/urlrouting.ashx?type=1000&amp;Module=Permits&amp;capID1=DUB16&amp;capID2=00000&amp;capID3=005H7&amp;agencyCode=TACOMA", "Longitude": "-122.489656", "Created_Date": "2016-05-04", "Parcel_Number": "2590000160", "Permit_Number": "LU16-0097", "_id": 460}, {"Description": "Build a detached accessory building (pole barn) on our property", "Address": "4744 BROWNS POINT BLVD", "Notice_Date": "", "Current_Status": "Closed", "Latitude": "47.299766", "Link": "https://aca.accela.com/tacoma/urlrouting.ashx?type=1000&amp;Module=Permits&amp;capID1=DUB16&amp;capID2=00000&amp;capID3=005H0&amp;agencyCode=TACOMA", "Longitude": "-122.42007", "Created_Date": "2016-05-04", "Parcel_Number": "0321215004", "Permit_Number": "LU16-0096", "_id": 461}, {"Description": "Zoning Verification letter for Wright Park House", "Address": "401 S G ST", "Notice_Date": "", "Current_Status": "Closed", "Latitude": "47.259657", "Link": "https://aca.accela.com/tacoma/urlrouting.ashx?type=1000&amp;Module=Permits&amp;capID1=DUB16&amp;capID2=00000&amp;capID3=005EO&amp;agencyCode=TACOMA", "Longitude": "-122.447018", "Created_Date": "2016-05-03", "Parcel_Number": "2004130010", "Permit_Number": "LU16-0095", "_id": 462}, {"Description": "We wish to build an RV Carport to park our boat and RV.

For the proposed development, 750 sf of the site remains not covered with building resulting in a 75 sf planting requirement. The 1,300 sf right-of-way along Ainsworth and 6th Avenue, now fully preserved, will be utilized for \"proposed landscaped areas\" with trees and shrubs meeting the planting requirements spelled out in the code and promoting residential activity on the street through the benefits of vegetation and shade.\r\n\r\nVARIANCE REQUEST #2\r\n5' Site Perimeter Landscaping, intended to ensure that areas abutting public rights-of-way, and not developed with structures, be attractive, and provide environmental benefits of vegetation.\r\n\r\nThe intent of the code is to ensure sites abutting \"public rights-of-way\" remain attractive, screening parking and driveways from view. Our proposal is to replace the 5' perimeter landscaping along the south P.L. with a green screen fence and a 1' planting area. This green screen fence would fulfill the intent to screen vehicles from the view in the direction of 607 Ainsworth.

In 2004, a log step fish ladder was constructed by Tacoma Public Utilities \u2013 Water Division (Tacoma Water) to allow anadromous fish access to Kanaskat Slough (formerly Brunner Slough). The project was part of a larger mitigation package for construction of the Tacoma Water Second Supply Pipeline Project (SSP) which was completed in 2005. Since construction, the ladder has provided access to adult coho salmon for spawning and rearing of subsequent off-spring. During a routine check of the project site in early November 2014, it was observed that the ladder was dry. Upon further investigation it was determined that flow was escaping the pond via three other outlet channels including the base of the existing beaver dam. The combined flow from these outlets was enough to lower the pond water surface to an elevation below the crest of the fish ladder. Since none of these outlets were passable, no coho accessed the pond in 2014 or 2015. Tacoma Water staff surveyed the site to determine a way to capture and redirect flow, escaping through the three other outlets, back to the fish ladder. At the time of the survey, damage to one of the ladder\u2019s log weirs was also observed. What follows is the description of a proposal to restore flow to the fish ladder and repair the damaged log weir. The proposed project will involve construction of a gravel bag dam on each of the three outlet channels immediately downstream of the pond. Based on cross-sectional surveys of each outlet channel, it was estimated that approximately 2,068 gravel bags would be needed to construct the dams to the elevation necessary to route flows over the fish ladder using the Army Corps of Engineers recommended construction technique of base width equal to three times height. The following equation was used to calculate the number of total bags necessary for the project. N = (3 x h) + (9 x h x h) / 2 N \u2013 Number of bags required per linear foot of dam h \u2013 Dam height (feet) Once the dams are constructed, some form of liner (e.g. Visqueen, tarps, or pond liner) would be placed on the upstream side of the three outlets (face) within the pond to block flow from escaping. Gravel bags would be used to anchor impermeable plastic sheeting to the face of each outlet location along the existing beaver dam to block flow. A jute fabric could also be laid over the impermeable fabric to reduce UV degradation and promote accumulation of detritus. The downstream side of each dam would be covered with jute mat and a layer of topsoil. Willow stakes and grass seed would then be added to the downstream side and covered with weed-free straw. The damaged log weir on the ladder would be repaired by building back the eroded right edge with 10-20 gravel bags and rekeying the log back into it.", "Address": "3628 S 35TH ST", "Notice_Date": "", "Current_Status": "Cancelled", "Latitude": "47.225121", "Link": "https://aca.accela.com/tacoma/urlrouting.ashx?type=1000&amp;Module=Permits&amp;capID1=DUB16&amp;capID2=00000&amp;capID3=003ZA&amp;agencyCode=TACOMA", "Longitude": "-122.485832", "Created_Date": "2016-04-05", "Parcel_Number": "0220131129", "Permit_Number": "LU16-0072", "_id": 487}, {"Description": "Please provide copies a zoning verification letter,any certificates of occupancy, variances, special/conditional-use permits (excluding signage), final approved site plan (excluding grading, landscaping, etc.), and any open/active zoning, building and fire code violations on file at this time for the properties located at 7605 7701 7601 7925 7805 7917 7921 705 South Hosmer Street, Parcels: 0320297020, 0320297021, 0320297022, 0320297023, 0320297024, 0320297025, 0320297026, 0320297026.

In 2004, a log step fish ladder was constructed by Tacoma Public Utilities \u2013 Water Division (Tacoma Water) to allow anadromous fish access to Kanaskat Slough (formerly Brunner Slough). The project was part of a larger mitigation package for construction of the Tacoma Water Second Supply Pipeline Project (SSP) which was completed in 2005. Since construction, the ladder has provided access to adult coho salmon for spawning and rearing of subsequent off-spring. During a routine check of the project site in early November 2014, it was observed that the ladder was dry. Upon further investigation it was determined that flow was escaping the pond via three other outlet channels including the base of the existing beaver dam. The combined flow from these outlets was enough to lower the pond water surface to an elevation below the crest of the fish ladder. Since none of these outlets were passable, no coho accessed the pond in 2014 or 2015. Tacoma Water staff surveyed the site to determine a way to capture and redirect flow, escaping through the three other outlets, back to the fish ladder. At the time of the survey, damage to one of the ladder\u2019s log weirs was also observed. What follows is the description of a proposal to restore flow to the fish ladder and repair the damaged log weir. \r\n\r\nThe proposed project will involve construction of a gravel bag dam on each of the three outlet channels immediately downstream of the pond. Based on cross-sectional surveys of each outlet channel, it was estimated that approximately 2,068 gravel bags would be needed to construct the dams to the elevation necessary to route flows over the fish ladder using the Army Corps of Engineers recommended construction technique of base width equal to three times height. The following equation was used to calculate the number of total bags necessary for the project.\r\n\r\nN = (3 x h) + (9 x h x h) / 2\r\nN \u2013 Number of bags required per linear foot of dam\r\nh \u2013 Dam height (feet)\r\n\r\nOnce the dams are constructed, some form of liner (e.g. Visqueen, tarps, or pond liner) would be placed on the upstream side of the three outlets (face) within the pond to block flow from escaping. Gravel bags would be used to anchor impermeable plastic sheeting to the face of each outlet location along the existing beaver dam to block flow. A jute fabric could also be laid over the impermeable fabric to reduce UV degradation and promote accumulation of detritus. The downstream side of each dam would be covered with jute mat and a layer of topsoil. Willow stakes and grass seed would then be added to the downstream side and covered with weed-free straw. The damaged log weir on the ladder would be repaired by building back the eroded right edge with 10-20 gravel bags and rekeying the log back into it.", "Address": "3628 S 35TH ST", "Notice_Date": "", "Current_Status": "Closed", "Latitude": "47.225121", "Link": "https://aca.accela.com/tacoma/urlrouting.ashx?type=1000&amp;Module=Permits&amp;capID1=DUB16&amp;capID2=00000&amp;capID3=003N5&amp;agencyCode=TACOMA", "Longitude": "-122.485832", "Created_Date": "2016-03-17", "Parcel_Number": "0220131129", "Permit_Number": "LU16-0065", "_id": 509}, {"Description": "To file a zoning verification letter in order to locate and obtain copies of records pertaining to building permits, building plans, or other building records for the property of interest from the City of Tacoma.", "Address": "815 S VASSAULT ST", "Notice_Date": "", "Current_Status": "Closed", "Latitude": "47.253262", "Link": "https://aca.accela.com/tacoma/urlrouting.ashx?type=1000&amp;Module=Permits&amp;capID1=DUB16&amp;capID2=00000&amp;capID3=0031B&amp;agencyCode=TACOMA", "Longitude": "-122.519852", "Created_Date": "2016-03-16", "Parcel_Number": "0220022129", "Permit_Number": "LU16-0051", "_id": 510}, {"Description": "Setback Variance for addition to SFR", "Address": "3722 N WASHINGTON ST", "Notice_Date": "", "Current_Status": "Closed", "Latitude": "47.282264", "Link": "https://aca.accela.com/tacoma/urlrouting.ashx?type=1000&amp;Module=Permits&amp;capID1=DUB16&amp;capID2=00000&amp;capID3=002YT&amp;agencyCode=TACOMA", "Longitude": "-122.485775", "Created_Date": "2016-03-15", "Parcel_Number": "5205000450", "Permit_Number": "LU16-0050", "_id": 511}, {"Description": "Proposed site development plans call for the construction of 5 new, apartment-style, multi-family, wood-framed buildings.

Initially , the existing buildings would be demolished and the site cleared for redevelopment.  There are 19 existing buildings and several smaller outbuildings that would be demolished.  The Phase 1 development consists of constructing a high bay cold storage area that would be approximately 137 feet high and approximately 160,500 square feet.  The high bay cold storage area would be fully automated with an oxygen reduction system that allows for extremely cold temperatures in the storage area.  The low oxygen in this area also prevents the potential for fire to occur.  To the south and attached to the high bay would be the dispatch area.  This would be a two story structure approximately 53 feet high where shipments coming in and going out would be assembled.  The dispatch area would be approximately 56,500 square feet in size and include 12,500 square feet of space consisting of offices and meeting rooms, workshop, inspection room and re-boxing area, QA laboratory, electrical control and switch area, driver\u2019s waiting area, kitchen and battery charging area (See attached floor plan schematics).  A dock yard would be situated next to the dispatch area with 12 truck trailer docks for outgoing products and 8 docks for incoming products.  The dock yard would include parking for approximately 90 truck/trailers.  Parking for 140 cars would also be constructed (this area would include handicapped spaces, space for electric car recharging and bicycle storage).  The project would provide employment for approximately 95 people.  Two stormwater detention ponds would be constructed to provide stormwater runoff treatment and storage at the north and south side of the site.  The ponds are located at both ends to maintain infiltrated flows into the two watersheds.  Landscaping would be provided and concentrated along the perimeter of the site, around the vehicle parking area, and in the detention pond area.  The project would provide several improvements in the right-of-way.  The truck access on South 46th Street would be widened and curb, gutter and sidewalks would be constructed.  An additional access point would be developed for car traffic off South 48th Street (there is an existing unused road that would be redeveloped).  Curb, gutter and sidewalk would be added to South 48th Street on the north side of the road.  \r\nThe Phase 2 expansion would develop another high bay storage area of the same size as the Phase 1 high bay (160,500) effectively doubling the capacity of the facility.

The seawater system improvement project largely entails equipment and conveyance replacement at the seawater intake structure (the \u201croundhouse\u201d) seaward and adjacent to the Owen Beach promenade and new pumps within a housing structure landward and adjacent to the same walkway. \r\n\r\nThe existing seawater supply facilities include offshore pumps installed in the roundhouse with two seawater supply lines extending through the bulkhead to valves located in an underground vault immediately across the promenade from the roundhouse location. Both the roundhouse and the vault are unsuitable for housing the replacement pumps, so a new 16-foot by 40-foot cast-in-place concrete pump building will be constructed approximately 55 feet to the southeast of the vault, installed into the toe of the slope. The building will house three centrifugal pumps, valves and piping as necessary to distribute seawater and allow for flushing of the supply lines. As this new structure will stand approximately 14-feet landward from the promenade, a portion of the slope must be excavated to accommodate the building. Soldier pile will be installed behind the new pump house facility to retain the steep hillside.\r\n\r\nThree 12-inch ductile iron pipe sleeves will replace the two lines between the roundhouse and the bulkhead, each housing one 10-inch polyethylene pipe.  \r\n\r\nThe aquariums are served by two seawater supply lines that will also be replaced within the proposed project. The existing asbestos cement pipes will be replaced with HDPE pipes that will be installed through a combination of open trenching and directional drilling. Each run of pipe will total approximately 725 feet.\r\n\r\nThe existing aquarium and rocky shores facilities require continuous seawater supply, therefore, construction will be phased to limit interruptions to the seawater supply.", "Address": "5400 N PEARL ST", "Notice_Date": "10/05/2017", "Current_Status": "Closed", "Latitude": "47.306015", "Link": "https://aca.accela.com/tacoma/urlrouting.ashx?type=1000&amp;Module=Permits&amp;capID1=DUB16&amp;capID2=00000&amp;capID3=00FNE&amp;agencyCode=TACOMA", "Longitude": "-122.528831", "Created_Date": "2016-12-16", "Parcel_Number": "0221103000", "Permit_Number": "LU16-0299", "_id": 244}, {"Description": "Short plat property to place the existing triplex buildings on separate tax parcels.", "Address": "4518 S JUNETT ST", "Notice_Date": "", "Current_Status": "Incomplete Application", "Latitude": "47.216081", "Link": "https://aca.accela.com/tacoma/urlrouting.ashx?type=1000&amp;Module=Permits&amp;capID1=DUB17&amp;capID2=00000&amp;capID3=00EPZ&amp;agencyCode=TACOMA", "Longitude": "-122.47549", "Created_Date": "2017-11-09", "Parcel_Number": "2890001920", "Permit_Number": "LU17-0238", "_id": 610}, {"Description": "Subdivision of 0.31 acre site into 2 residential building lots in the R2 zone", "Address": "816 E 68TH ST", "Notice_Date": "", "Current_Status": "Plan Review in Progress", "Latitude": "47.195053", "Link": "https://aca.accela.com/tacoma/urlrouting.ashx?type=1000&amp;Module=Permits&amp;capID1=DUB17&amp;capID2=00000&amp;capID3=00F08&amp;agencyCode=TACOMA", "Longitude": "-122.420187", "Created_Date": "2017-11-16", "Parcel_Number": "0320272109", "Permit_Number": "LU17-0245", "_id": 617}, {"Description": "Development of a new single family home site consistent with the neighborhood within an existing vacant parcel.
